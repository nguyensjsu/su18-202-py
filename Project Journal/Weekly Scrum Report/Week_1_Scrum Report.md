Past Week
- We focussed on defining the problem. We also had a brainstorm session to figure what might be interesting features we might want to build on top of the basic ones.

- I created wireframes for the app, which help see the different user journeys.

- We created a Data Model which will support the Use Cases we want to tackle.The basic infrastructure for a spring boot application with DynamoDB has been set up.

Next Week
- We intend to complete our respective APIs and also merge it together.

Blockers/Challenges
- We are not sure about deploying into Docker containers. We hope to make progress on that front.
